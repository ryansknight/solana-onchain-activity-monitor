"""
SQLite persistence for the on-chain activity monitor.

Replaces the per-day CSVs with a single DB. `sqlite3` is stdlib, so this stays
zero-dependency. The schema is derived from monitor.CSV_FIELDS with automatic
ALTER-based column evolution (adding a signal is a one-liner, no file migration),
each sample is an ACID insert (no truncate-then-write corruption window), and the
baselines / charts / percentiles read time-ranged slices in SQL instead of loading
whole files. A one-time importer folds any legacy per-day CSVs into the DB.

Only functions touch monitor at call time (never at import), so the mutual
monitor<->store import resolves lazily with no cycle.
