Real-time web dashboard for the on-chain activity monitor.

Backend: stdlib http.server (no dependencies). A background thread runs the
same collection as monitor.py once per `--interval`, keeps a rolling history,
and the pump.fun launch stream updates continuously. The page polls /api/data
and redraws.

    python3 server.py                 # http://127.0.0.1:8888
    python3 server.py --port 9000 --interval 30

Endpoints:
    GET /            -> dashboard.html
    GET /api/data    -> latest snapshot + history + fresh pump rates + movers
    GET /api/surge   -> tiny backoff verdict for a lander to poll (advise_backoff,
                        throttle_factor, level, reason, action)
